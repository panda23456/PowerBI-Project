# PowerBI-Project
This project showcases my skills in leveraging Power BI for data analysis and visualization, highlighting key insights from Prestige Mall. The dashboard includes visual representations of customer demographics by job sector, water and energy usage, monthly visitor trends, and average spending patterns at the mall between 2018 and 2020. A 'Year' filter allows for dynamic exploration of these insights.
