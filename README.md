# PowerBI-Project
This project demonstrates my proficiency in using Power BI for data presentation and analysis, focusing on insights from Prestige Mall. Key visualizations include customer distribution by job sector, water and energy consumption, monthly customer visits, and the average spending at the mall from 2018 to 2020. These insights can be interactively filtered using a 'Year' filter.
